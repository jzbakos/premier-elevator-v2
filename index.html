          <h1><span class="accent">WHO</span> WE ARE</h1>
          <p>
            In 1970, Luca Mele began his career in the elevator industry. His
            superior craftsmanship was quickly noticed by management and Luca
            soon became Shop Foreman for a prominent elevator company. From a
            very early age, Lucaâ€™s son Dino developed an interest in fine
            cabinetry skills through working alongside his father. Dino started
            working in the elevator industry in the late seventies, specializing
            in many departments, including structural steel and elevator
            fixtures.
            <br />
            <br />
            In 1992, Luca and Dino Mele founded Premier Elevator, merging old
            world craftsmanship with efficient, modern technology. They began in
            a small 3,000 square foot shop and worked extremely well together as
            a father and son team, creatively coming up with solutions and then
            using highly developed skills to implement their designs. With
            increased client demand and the addition of efficient CNC
            (Computerized Numerical Control) manufacturing equipment, their
            production facility quickly grew into our current 65,000 square foot
            facility. Dino and Luca continue to work together at Premier
            Elevator, collaborating with our skilled teams to create custom
            solutions for buildings of all sizes.
